The Oregon Trail is a collection of location points that connect from one to another in a line. And it runs through multiple Zones/States/Territories. A person can only inhabit a single TrailPoint at a time. A trail Point can only exist in one Zone and Biome at a time.

A Zone have have multiple terrain types and weather outlooks.

A Biome could be a single grouping of terrain and weather.
A Zone can have multiple Biomes, a Biome can  have multiple TrailPoints.

A TrailPoint is a single location with a 2 mile diameter. when a caravan enters a point, they have 2 miles to go until the next one. Depending on the elevation of the current TrailPoint and the surrounding ones, assessments can be made about weather, possible threats, and navigation.

While travelling through the Points and Biomes, the caravan is also progressing through a Zone/Region.
Each Zone/Region represents a major leg of the journey. Regions determine the Governing body of the land as well as the local peoples a caravan might run into.

Animals and Resources are determined by the Biome's Terrain. The current availability of said Animals and Resources is affected by the Biome's Weather.


## OnTrail Points
A player moves from TrailPoint to TrailPoint and travels through Biomes. Biomes provide different combinations of Terrain and Weather. There may be two Biomes with the same Terrain next to eachother, but different Weather.


## OffTrail Points
A Town is a Point that is off the trail. When at a crossroad in the trail, a caravan may decide to head off trail 1 mile and enter the Town/Settlement. A Town provides possible Recruits for the caravan as well as Trade.
